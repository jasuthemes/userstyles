# Themes
This will include any UserStyles I have created or edited. A browser add-on is needed to install custom UserStyles. I recommend [Stylus](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus), which is available for both [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/) and [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne?hl).
